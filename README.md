# YouTube-Analysis-Project-Data-Engineering
Data Engineering Project

## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a data pipeline that can securely manage, streamline, and analyze YouTube video data. The data to be used in this project is structured and semi-structured YouTube video data. This data includes information such as the video title, description, tags, views, likes, dislikes, and comments.

## Project Goal
1. Data ingestion: The first step is to ingest the data from YouTube. This can be done by using the YouTube Data API. The API allows you to extract data about videos, channels, and other aspects of YouTube.
2. ETL system: Once the data has been ingested, it needs to be transformed into a format that can be easily analyzed. This is done by an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) system. The ETL system will clean the data, remove any errors, and transform it into a format that can be stored in a data lake.
3. Data lake: The data lake is a centralized repository where the data is stored. The data lake should be scalable so that it can handle the increasing amount of data.
4. Scalability: The data engineering system should be scalable so that it can handle the increasing amount of data. This can be done by using cloud computing services, such as AWS.
5. Cloud: The data engineering system should be hosted in the cloud so that it can be accessed from anywhere. This is also beneficial because the cloud can provide the scalability and computing power that is needed to process large amounts of data.
6. Reporting: The final step is to build a dashboard to visualize the data. This will allow you to get answers to the questions that you have about the data.
